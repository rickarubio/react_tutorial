## Observations
I thought at first that it wouldn't be much of an issue to
use regular JS syntax instead of JSX syntax.  
  
Unfortunately, most of the React documentation is in JSX syntax.  
  
I used the online JSX compiler to understand the JSX syntax
http://facebook.github.io/react/jsx-compiler.html  
  
In hindsight, just use the JSX syntax if like me, you're learning React.
